Code of Conduct
===============

This is a project conveyed in the author's free time. It is his little
act of charity to make this world an (even) better place.
It will most likely pass unnoticed, but if you happen to find it useful,
informative, amusing, or stimulating, I am happy for you.

Please read this book's introductory part for an overview of the philosophy
it implements; maybe it already addresses your concerns. Also, give
yourself some time, some ideas might just not be obvious at first glance.

Most likely, if I wrote X, came up with an assumption Y, or made a design
choice Z, there have been strong reasons for it. Try to find them yourself.

I am generally quite busy and might have no time to reply to queries
which have been clarified herein or in other easily accessible references;
seeking answers on your own will help you become more independent;
this is how we all learn, after all.

Any bug/typos reports/fixes are appreciated, as well as interesting and
non-trivial remarks that could lead to the improvement of the presented
material or my learning something noteworthy. Please use the
[*Issues*](https://github.com/gagolews/datawranglingpy/issues)
tracker to notify me about any issues discovered.

Good luck!
