<h2>The Art of Data Wrangling<a class="headerlink" href="#the-art-of-data-wrangling" title="Permalink to this headline"></a></h2>
<p><em>Data science</em><a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="#footds" id="id1">1</a> aims at making sense of and generating predictions
from data that have<a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="#footdataplural" id="id2">2</a> been collected in copious quantities
from various sources, such as physical sensors, surveys, online forms,
access logs, and (pseudo)random number generators, to name a few.
They can take diverse forms, e.g., vectors, matrices, and other tensors,
graphs/networks, audio/video streams, text, etc.</p>
<p>Researchers in psychology, economics, sociology, agriculture,
engineering, biotechnology, pharmacy, medicine, and genetics,
amongst many others,
need statistical methods to make discoveries
as well as confirm or falsify existing theories.
What is more, with the increased availability of open data, everyone can
do remarkable work for the common good, e.g., by volunteering
for non-for-profit NGOs or debunking false news and overzealous acts
of wishful thinking on any side of the political spectra.</p>
<p>Furthermore, data scientists, machine learning engineers,
statisticians, and business analysts are
<a class="reference external" href="https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2021#other-frameworks-and-libraries">the most well-paid specialists</a>.
This is because data-driven decision-making, modelling, and
prediction proved themselves especially useful in many domains:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>healthcare,</p></li>
<li><p>food production,</p></li>
<li><p>pharmaceuticals,</p></li>
<li><p>transportation,</p></li>
<li><p>financial services (banking, insurance, investment funds),</p></li>
<li><p>real estate,</p></li>
<li><p>retail.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Okay, to be frank, the above list was generated by duckduckgoing
the “biggest industries” query. That was an easy task.
Data science (and its different flavours, including operational
research, machine learning, business and artificial intelligence)
can be applied wherever we have some relevant data at hand and
there is a need to improve or understand the underlying processes.</p>
<div class="proof proof-type-exercise" id="id15">

    <div class="proof-title">
        <span class="proof-type">Exercise 1</span>
        
    </div><div class="proof-content">
<p>Miniaturisation, increased computing power, cheaper storage,
and the popularity of various internet services
all caused data to become ubiquitous.
Think about how much information people consume and generate when they
interact with different news feeds or social media on their phones.</p>
</div></div><p>Data usually do not come in a <em>tidy</em> and <em>tamed</em> form.
Also, at first glance, it is rarely known what we can get out of them.
And thus, <em>data wrangling</em> is the very broad process of appropriately
curating raw information chunks and then exploring the
underlying data structure so that they become <em>analysable</em>.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="aims-scope-and-design-philosophy">
<h2>Aims, Scope, and Design Philosophy<a class="headerlink" href="#aims-scope-and-design-philosophy" title="Permalink to this headline"></a></h2>
<p>This course is envisaged as a student’s first, broad,
yet well-structured exposure to data science<a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="#footalttitle" id="id3">3</a>.</p>
<p>By no means do we have the ambition to be comprehensive with regard to
any topic we cover. Time for that will come later
in dedicated units related to calculus, matrix algebra, probability,
mathematical statistics, continuous and combinatorial optimisation,
information theory, stochastic processes,
statistical/machine learning, algorithms and data structures,
take a deep breath, databases and big data analytics,
operational research, graphs and networks, differential equations
and dynamical systems,
time series analysis, signal processing, etc.</p>
<p>Instead, we lay very solid groundwork for all the above
by introducing all the objects at an appropriate level of generality
and building the most crucial connections between them.
We provide the necessary intuitions behind the more advanced methods
and concepts. This way, further courses do not need to waste our time
introducing the most elementary definitions and answering the metaphysical
questions like “but why do we need that (e.g., matrix multiplication) at all”.</p>
<div style="margin-top: 1em"></div><p>And thus, in this course, we are going to explore methods for:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>performing exploratory data analysis (e.g., aggregation and
visualisation),</p></li>
<li><p>working with different types of data (e.g., numerical,
categorical, text, time series),</p></li>
<li><p>cleaning data gathered from structured and unstructured sources,
e.g., by identifying outliers, normalising strings, extracting
numbers from text, imputing missing data,</p></li>
<li><p>transforming, selecting, and extracting features, dimensionality reduction,</p></li>
<li><p>identifying naturally occurring data clusters, comparing data between groups,</p></li>
<li><p>discovering patterns in data via approximation/modelling approaches
using the most popular probability distributions
and the easiest to understand statistical/machine learning algorithms,</p></li>
<li><p>testing whether two data distributions differ significantly from each other,</p></li>
<li><p>reporting the results of data analysis.</p></li>
</ul>
<div style="margin-top: 1em"></div><p>We primarily focus on methods and algorithms that stood
the test of time and that continue to inspire researchers
and practitioners.
They all meet a reality check that is comprised of the three
following properties, which we believe are essential
in practice:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>simplicity (and thus interpretability,
being equipped with no or only a few underlying tunable parameters;
being based on some sensible intuitions that can be explained
in our own words),</p></li>
<li><p>mathematical analysability (at least to some extent;
so that we can understand their strengths and limitations),</p></li>
<li><p>implementability (not too abstract on the one hand,
but also not requiring any advanced computer-y hocus-pocus
on the other).</p></li>
</ul>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="admonition-title">Note</p>
<p>Many <em>more complex</em> algorithms are merely variations
on or clever combinations of the more basic ones. This is why
we need to study the fundamentals in great detail.
We might not see it now, but this will become evident as we progress.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="we-need-maths">
<h3>We Need Maths<a class="headerlink" href="#we-need-maths" title="Permalink to this headline"></a></h3>
<p>The maths we introduce is the most elementary possible, in a good sense.
Namely, we do not go beyond:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>simple analytic functions (affine maps, logarithms, cosines),</p></li>
<li><p>the natural linear ordering of points on the real line
(and the lack thereof in the case of multidimensional data),</p></li>
<li><p>the sum of squared differences between things (including
the Euclidean distance between points),</p></li>
<li><p>linear vector/matrix algebra, e.g.,
to represent the most useful
geometric transforms (rotation, scaling, translation),</p></li>
<li><p>the frequentist interpretation
(as in: <em>in samples of large sizes, we expect that…</em>)
of some common objects from probability
theory and statistics.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>This is the kind of toolkit that we believe is a
<em>sine qua non</em> requirement for every prospective data scientist.
We cannot escape falling in love with it.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="we-need-some-computing-environment">
<h3>We Need Some Computing Environment<a class="headerlink" href="#we-need-some-computing-environment" title="Permalink to this headline"></a></h3>
<p>We no longer practice data analysis using a piece of paper
and a pencil<a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="#footwhyprogramming" id="id4">4</a>. Even though there are some dedicated
computer programs that solve the <em>most common</em> problems
arising in the most straightforward scenarios (e.g., spreadsheet-like click-here
click-there stand-alone statistical packages),
we need a tool that will enable us to respond to <em>any</em> challenge
in a scientifically rigorous (and hence well organised
and documented as well as reproducible) manner.</p>
<p>In this course, we will be writing code in Python,
which we will introduce from scratch;
thus, we do not require any prior programming experience.</p>
<p>The <a class="reference external" href="https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2021#technology-most-popular-technologies">2021 StackOverflow Developer Survey</a>
lists it as the 2nd most popular programming language nowadays
(slightly behind JavaScript). Over the last few years, Python has proven to be
a very robust choice for learning and applying data wrangling techniques.
This is possible thanks to the
<a class="reference external" href="https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2021#other-frameworks-and-libraries">famous</a>
high-quality packages written by the devoted community of open-source
programmers, including but not limited to
<strong class="program">numpy</strong>,
<strong class="program">scipy</strong>,
<strong class="program">pandas</strong>,
<strong class="program">matplotlib</strong>,
<strong class="program">seaborn</strong>, and
<strong class="program">scikit-learn</strong>.</p>
<p>Still, Python and third-party packages which are written therein
are amongst <em>many</em> software tools which can help gain new knowledge
from data. Other<a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="#footnonfree" id="id5">5</a> open-source choices include, e.g.,
<a class="reference external" href="https://www.r-project.org/">R</a> and <a class="reference external" href="https://julialang.org/">Julia</a>.
And many new ones will emerge in the future.</p>
<div class="admonition important">
<p class="admonition-title">Important</p>
<p>We will emphasise developing <em>transferable skills</em>:
most of what we learn here can be applied (using a different
syntax but the same kind of reasoning) in other environments.
In other words, this is a course on data wrangling
(<em>with</em> Python), not a course <em>on</em> Python
(with examples in data wrangling).</p>
</div>
<p>We want the reader to become an <em>independent</em> user of
this computing environment. Somebody who is not overwhelmed when
they are faced with any intermediate-level data analysis problem.
A user whose habitual response to a new challenge is not
to look everything up on the internet even in the simplest
possible scenarios. In other words, we value creative thinking.</p>
<p>We believe we have found a good trade-off
between the minimal set of tools that need to be mastered
and the less frequently used ones that can later be found
in the documentation or on the internet.
In other words, the reader will discover the joy of programming
and using their logical thinking to tinker with things.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="we-need-data-and-domain-knowledge">
<h3>We Need Data and Domain Knowledge<a class="headerlink" href="#we-need-data-and-domain-knowledge" title="Permalink to this headline"></a></h3>
<p>There is no data science or machine learning without <em>data</em>,
and data’s purpose is to represent a given problem domain.
Mathematics allows us to study different processes at a healthy
level of abstractness/specificity. Still, we should always be familiar
with the reality behind the numbers we have at hand, for example,
by working closely with various experts in the field of our interest
or pursuing our own study/research therein.</p>
<p>Courses such as this one, out of necessity, must use some generic datasets
that are quite familiar to most readers (e.g.,
data on life expectancy and GDP in different countries,
time to finish a marathon, yearly household incomes).</p>
<p>Still, many textbooks introduce statistical concepts using
carefully crafted datasets where everything runs smoothly,
and all models work out of the box. This gives a false sense of security.
In practice, however, most datasets are not only unpolished
but also (even after some careful treatment) uninteresting. Such is life.
We will not be avoiding the <em>more difficult</em> problems in our
journey.</p>

<ol class="simple">
<li><p>Introducing Python:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><a class="reference internal" href="110-setup.html#chap-setup"><span class="std std-numref">Chapter 1</span></a> discusses how to execute the first
code chunks in Jupyter Notebooks, which are a flexible tool for
the reproducible generation of reports from data analyses.</p></li>
<li><p><a class="reference internal" href="120-scalar.html#chap-scalar"><span class="std std-numref">Chapter 2</span></a> introduces the basic scalar types
in base Python, ways to call existing and to write our own functions,
and control a code chunk’s execution flow.</p></li>
<li><p><a class="reference internal" href="130-sequential.html#chap-sequential"><span class="std std-numref">Chapter 3</span></a> mentions sequential and
other iterable types in base Python;
more advanced data structures (vectors, matrices, data frames)

</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Unidimensional Data:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><a class="reference internal" href="210-vector.html#chap-vector"><span class="std std-numref">Chapter 4</span></a> introduces vectors from <strong class="program">numpy</strong>,
which we use for storing data on the real line
(think: individual columns in a tabular dataset).
Then, we look at the most common types
of empirical distributions of data (e.g., bell-shaped,
right-skewed, heavy-tailed ones).</p></li>
<li><p>In <a class="reference internal" href="220-transform-vector.html#chap-transform-vector"><span class="std std-numref">Chapter 5</span></a> we list the most basic
ways for processing sequences of numbers, including
methods for data aggregation, transformation (e.g., standardisation),
and filtering. We also mention that a computer’s floating-point
arithmetic is imprecise and what we can do about it.</p></li>
<li><p><a class="reference internal" href="230-distribution.html#chap-distribution"><span class="std std-numref">Chapter 6</span></a> reviews the most common
probability distributions
(normal, log-normal, Pareto, Uniform, and mixtures thereof),
methods for assessing how well they fit empirical data,
and pseudorandom number generation that is crucial
for experiments based on simulations.</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Multidimensional Data:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><a class="reference internal" href="310-matrix.html#chap-matrix"><span class="std std-numref">Chapter 7</span></a> introduces matrices from <strong class="program">numpy</strong>.
They are a convenient means of storing multidimensional quantitative
data (many points described by possibly many numerical features).
We also present some methods for their visualisation
(and the problems arising from our being three-dimensional
creatures).</p></li>
<li><p><a class="reference internal" href="320-transform-matrix.html#chap-transform-matrix"><span class="std std-numref">Chapter 8</span></a> is devoted to basic
operations on matrices. We will see that some of them simply extend
on what we learned in <a class="reference internal" href="220-transform-vector.html#chap-transform-vector"><span class="std std-numref">Chapter 5</span></a>,
but there is more: for instance, we discuss how to determine
the set of each point’s nearest neighbours.</p></li>
<li><p><a class="reference internal" href="330-relationship.html#chap-relationship"><span class="std std-numref">Chapter 9</span></a> discusses ways to explore
the most basic relationships between the variables in a dataset:
the Pearson and Spearman correlation coefficients
(and what it means that correlation is not causation),
<em>k</em>-nearest neighbour and linear regression
(including the sad cases where a model matrix is ill-conditioned),
and finding interesting combinations of variables
that can help reduce the dimensionality of a problem
(via the so-called principal component analysis).</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Heterogeneous Data:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><a class="reference internal" href="410-data-frame.html#chap-data-frame"><span class="std std-numref">Chapter 10</span></a> introduces <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Series</span></code> and <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">DataFrame</span></code>
objects from <strong class="program">pandas</strong>, which we can think of as
vectors and matrices on steroids. For instance, they allow
rows and columns to be labelled
and columns to be of different types.
We emphasise that most of what we learned in the previous chapters
still applies, but there is even more: for example,
methods for joining (merging) many datasets,
converting between long and wide formats, etc.</p></li>
<li><p>In <a class="reference internal" href="420-categorical.html#chap-categorical"><span class="std std-numref">Chapter 11</span></a> we introduce the ways to
represent and handle categorical data as well as
how (not) to lie with statistics.</p></li>
<li><p><a class="reference internal" href="430-group-by.html#chap-group-by"><span class="std std-numref">Chapter 12</span></a> covers the case of aggregating,
transforming, and visualising data in groups by one or more
qualitative variables, including classification with <em>k</em>-nearest neighbours (when we are asked to fill the gaps in a categorical variable). We will also try to discover the naturally occurring
partitions with the <em>k</em>-means method, which is an example
of a computationally hard optimisation problem that needs to be
tackled with some imperfect heuristics.</p></li>
<li><p><a class="reference internal" href="440-sql.html#chap-sql"><span class="std std-numref">Chapter 13</span></a> is an interlude where we solve some pleasant
exercises on data frames and learn the basics of SQL.
This will be useful when we are faced with datasets that
do not fit into a computer’s memory.</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Other Data Types:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><a class="reference internal" href="510-text.html#chap-text"><span class="std std-numref">Chapter 14</span></a> discusses ways to handle text data
and extract information from them, e.g.,
through regular expressions. We also briefly mention
the challenges related to the processing of non-English text,
including phrases like <em>pozdro dla ziomali z Bródna</em>,
<em>Viele Grüße und viel Spaß</em>, and <em>χαίρετε</em>.</p></li>
<li><p><a class="reference internal" href="520-missingness.html#chap-missingness"><span class="std std-numref">Chapter 15</span></a> emphasises that some data may be
missing or be questionable (e.g., censored, incorrect,
rare) and what we can do about them.</p></li>
<li><p>In <a class="reference internal" href="530-time-series.html#chap-time-series"><span class="std std-numref">Chapter 16</span></a> we cover the most basic methods
for the processing of time series, because, ultimately, everything
changes, and we should be able to track the evolution of things.</p></li>

<p>(*)
Parts marked with a single or double asterisk
can be skipped upon first reading as they are of increased difficulty
and are not essential for beginner students.</p>

<div class="section" id="the-rules">
<span id="sec-rules"></span><h2>The Rules<a class="headerlink" href="#the-rules" title="Permalink to this headline"></a></h2>
<p>Our goal here, in the long run, is for you, dear reader,
to become a skilled
expert who is independent, ethical, and capable of critical thinking;
one who hopefully will make a small contribution towards making this world
a slightly better place.</p>
<p>To guide you through it, we have a few tips for you.</p>
<ol class="simple">
<li><p><em>Follow the rules.</em></p></li>
<li><p><em>Technical textbooks are not belletristic.</em>
Sometimes a single page
will be very meaning-intense. Do not try to consume too much
at the same time. Go for a walk, reflect on what you learned,
and build connections between different concepts.
In case of any doubt, go back to one of the previous sections.
Learning is an iterative process, not a linear one.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Solve all the suggested exercises.</em>
We might be introducing new concepts or developing crucial
intuitions there as well.
Also, try implementing most of the methods you learn about from scratch
instead of looking for copy-paste solutions on the internet.
How else will you master the material and develop the
necessary programming skills?</p></li>
<li><p><em>Code is an integral part of the text.</em>
Each piece of good code is worth 1234 words (on average).
Do not skip it. On the contrary, you should play and experiment with it.
Run every major line of code, inspect the
results generated, and read more about the functions you use
in the official documentation. What is the type (class)
of the object returned?
If it is an array or a data frame, what is its shape?
What would happen if we replaced X with Y?
Do not fret; your computer will not blow up.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Harden up<a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="#footrule5" id="id6">6</a>.</em>
Your journey towards expertise will take years, there are no shortcuts,
but it will be quite enjoyable every now and then, so don’t give up.
Still, sitting all day in front of your computer is unhealthy –
exercise and socialise between 28 and 31 times per month,
because you’re not, nor will ever be, a robot.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Learn maths.</em>
Our field has a very long history and stands on the shoulders of
many giants; many methods we use these days are merely minor variations
on the classical, fundamental results that date back to
Newton, Leibniz, Gauss, and Laplace. Therefore, eventually,
you will need some working knowledge of mathematics
to understand them (linear algebra,
calculus, probability and statistics).
Remember that software products/APIs seem to change frequently,
but they are just a facade, a flashy wrapping around the methods
we were using for quite a while.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Use only methods that you can explain.</em>
Even though they may be easily accessible,
you should refrain from working with
algorithms/methods/models whose definitions
(pseudocode, mathematical formulae, objective functions they
are trying to optimise) and properties
you do not know, understand, or cannot rephrase in your own words.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Compromises are inevitable<a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="#footfreelunch" id="id7">7</a>.</em>
There will never be a single best metric, algorithm, or way to solve all
the problems. Even though some solutions might be better than others
with regard to specific criteria, this will only be true
under certain assumptions (<em>if</em> they fit a theoretical model).
Beware that focusing too much on one aspect
leads to undesirable consequences with respect to other factors,
especially those that cannot be measured easily.
Therefore, refraining from improving things might sometimes be better
than pushing too hard. Always apply common sense.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Be scientific and ethical.</em>
Make your reports reproducible, your toolkit well-organised,
and all the assumptions you make explicit.
Develop a dose of scepticism and impartiality
towards everything, from marketing slogans, through your
ideological biases, to all hotly debated topics.
Most data analysis exercises end up with conclusions
like: “it’s too early to tell”, “data don’t show it’s either way”,
“there is a difference, but it is hardly significant”,
“yeah, but our sample is not representative for the entire
population” – and there is nothing wrong with this.
Remember that it is highly unethical to use statistics to tell lies;
this includes presenting only one side of the overly complex reality
and totally ignoring all the other ones (compare Rule#8).
Using statistics for doing dreadful things
(tracking users to find their vulnerabilities,
developing products and services which are addictive)
is a huge no-no!</p></li>
<li><p><em>The best things in life are free.</em>
These include the open-source software and open-access textbooks
(such as this one) we use in our journey.
Spread the good news about them and – if you can – contribute something
(even as small as reporting typos in their documentation
or helping others in different forums when they are stuck with something)
so that you are not only a taker.
After all, it is our shared responsibility.</p></li>

<p><em>Minimalist Data Wrangling with Python</em> is based on my experience

(Data Processing and Analysis in Python), <span id="id8">[<a class="reference internal" href="999-bibliography.html#id3">GBC16</a>]</span>
that I wrote (in Polish, 2016, published by PWN)
with my former (successful) PhD students
Maciej Bartoszuk and Anna Cena – thanks!
The current book is an entirely different work; however,
its predecessor served as an excellent testbed for many ideas conveyed here.</p>
<p>The teaching style exercised in this book has proven successful
in many similar courses that yours truly has been responsible for,
including at Warsaw University of Technology,
Data Science Retreat (Berlin), and Deakin University (Geelong/Melbourne).
I thank all my students for the feedback given over the last 10 or so years.</p>
