<h2>The Art of Data Wrangling<a class="headerlink" href="#the-art-of-data-wrangling" title="Permalink to this headline">ÔÉÅ</a></h2>
<p>The broadly-conceived <em>data science</em><a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="#footds" id="id1">1</a> aims at making sense of and
generating predictions from data that have been collected in large quantities
from various sources, e.g., physical sensors,
files, databases, or (pseudo)random number generators.
It can take different forms, e.g., vectors, matrices
and other tensors, graphs, audio/video streams, text, etc.
With the advent of the internet era, data have become ubiquitous.</p>
<div class="proof proof-type-exercise" id="id11">

    <div class="proof-title">
        <span class="proof-type">Exercise 1</span>
        
    </div><div class="proof-content">
<p>Think about how much information you consume and generate when you
interact with social media or news feeds every day.</p>
</div></div><p>Data-driven decision making, modelling, and prediction has already proven
itself very useful in numerous different domains:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>healthcare,</p></li>
<li><p>food production,</p></li>
<li><p>pharmaceuticals,</p></li>
<li><p>transportation,</p></li>
<li><p>financial services (banking, insurance, investment funds),</p></li>
<li><p>real estate,</p></li>
<li><p>retail.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Okay, to be frank, the above list was generated by duckduckgoing
the ‚Äúbiggest industries‚Äù query. That was a very easy task;
data science (and its very different flavours,
including statistics, operational research, machine learning,
artificial intelligence, and so forth) is everywhere.
Basically, wherever we have data and there is a need to improve
some processes or discover new aspects about a problem domain,
there is a place for data-driven solutions.</p>
<p>Of course, it‚Äôs not all about business revenue (luckily). We can do a lot
of great work for greater good; with the increased availability of open data,
everyone can be a reporter, an engaged citizen that seeks truth,
a volunteer for a non-for profit NGO, etc.
Also, there are researchers (remember that the main
role of most universities is still to spread the advancement of
knowledge and not to make money!) that need these methods to make new
discoveries, e.g., in psychology, economics, sociology, agriculture,
engineering, biotechnology, pharmacy, medicine, genetics, you name it.</p>
<div class="admonition important">
<p class="admonition-title">Important</p>
<p>Data rarely come in a <em>tidy</em> and <em>tamed</em> form.
Performing accurate exploration and modelling heavily
relies on <em>data wrangling</em>, which is the very broad process of appropriately
preparing raw data for further analysis.</p>
</div>
<p>And thus, in this course, we are going to explore methods for:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>performing exploratory data analysis,
including aggregating and visualising numerical and categorical data,</p></li>
<li><p>working with different types of data (e.g., numerical,
categorical, text, time series),</p></li>
<li><p>cleaning data gathered from structured and unstructured sources,
e.g., by identifying outliers, normalising strings, extracting
numbers from text, imputing missing data,</p></li>
<li><p>transforming, selecting, and extracting features, dimensionality reduction,</p></li>
<li><p>identifying naturally occurring data clusters, comparing data between groups,</p></li>
<li><p>data approximation/modelling using the simplest probability distributions
and the most easy to understand statistical/machine learning algorithms.</p></li>
</ul>

<div class="section" id="aims-scope-and-design-philosophy">
<h2>Aims, Scope, and Design Philosophy<a class="headerlink" href="#aims-scope-and-design-philosophy" title="Permalink to this headline">ÔÉÅ</a></h2>
<p>Most of the time during the course of this course, we will be writing code
in <a class="reference external" href="https://www.python.org/">Python</a>.
The <a class="reference external" href="https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2021#technology-most-popular-technologies">2021 StackOverflow Developer Survey</a>
lists it as the 2nd most popular programming language used nowadays
(slightly behind JavaScript).</p>
<p>Over the last years, Python has proven a very robust choice for
learning and applying data wrangling techniques.
This is possible thanks to the
<a class="reference external" href="https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2021#other-frameworks-and-libraries">famous</a>
high quality packages written by the devoted community of open source
programmers, including but not limited to
<a class="reference external" href="https://numpy.org/"><strong class="program">numpy</strong></a>,
<a class="reference external" href="https://scipy.org/"><strong class="program">scipy</strong></a>,
<a class="reference external" href="https://pandas.pydata.org/"><strong class="program">pandas</strong></a>,
<a class="reference external" href="https://matplotlib.org/"><strong class="program">matplotlib</strong></a>,
<a class="reference external" href="https://seaborn.pydata.org/"><strong class="program">seaborn</strong></a>, and
<a class="reference external" href="https://scikit-learn.org/"><strong class="program">sklearn</strong></a>.</p>
<div class="admonition important">
<p class="admonition-title">Important</p>
<p>Note that we will introduce the Python language from scratch
and that we do not require any prior programming experience.
Nevertheless, learning how to code is hard work; if you want to succeed,
you will have to spend a decent amount of time getting your hands dirty by
writing programs which solve the suggested problem sets, studying
technical manuals, and so forth. One does not became a qualified
and respected engineer by simply <em>reading</em> online tutorials or books.</p>
</div>
<p>Python and third-party packages written therein
are amongst many software tools which can help gain new knowledge
from data.
Other open source choices include, e.g.,
<a class="reference external" href="https://www.r-project.org/">R</a> and <a class="reference external" href="https://julialang.org/">Julia</a>.
There are also some commercial solutions available on the market,
but we believe that ultimately
<a class="reference external" href="https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.en.html">all software should be free</a>,
therefore we are not going to talk about them at all.</p>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="admonition-title">Note</p>
<p>We put great emphasis on developing <em>transferable skills</em> so that
all that we learn here can be then applied quite easily in other
environments. In other words, this is a course on data wrangling
(<em>with</em> Python), and not a course <em>on</em> Python (with examples in data wrangling).
This is not a book of recipes. We are aiming for understanding
and becoming independent learners.</p>
</div>
<p>The skills we are going to develop in this course are <em>fundamental</em>
for the success in the numerous jobs available in our industry all over
the world.
And data engineers, data scientists, machine learning specialists,
statisticians, and business analysts are
<a class="reference external" href="https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2021#other-frameworks-and-libraries">amongst the most well-paid specialists</a>.
Money does not bring joy, but luckily it is a very interesting
domain anyway.
All what we shall learn here can be used for improving different processes,
in research, helping NGOs, debunking false news or wishful thinking,
maintaining quality of various industries,
and doing any other good deeds for the advancement of humanity.</p>
<p>We are going to study many methods and algorithms that stood
the test of time and that continue to inspire the researchers
and practitioners. After all, many <em>complex</em> algorithms
are merely variations on or clever combinations of
the most basic ones. You might not see it now, but
this will become evident as we progress.</p>
<p>Most importantly, however, we will get to know their limitations, which
they are many. Being sceptical and cautious is one of the traits of a
good scientist.</p>
<p>Note that we will definitely not be avoiding
mathematical notation so as to maintain a healthy level of
generality. Mathematics is both a  universal  tool and a language
for describing the methods for processing various data structures
and analysing the properties thereof.
The people fluent in mathematics are those who have
invented or derived most of the methods discussed herein,
we must thus be too.</p>

<div class="admonition note">
<p class="admonition-title">Note</p>
<p>This part is under construction. Please come back later.</p>
</div>
<p>The material has been divided into 5 parts.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="the-rules">
<span id="sec-rules"></span><h2>The Rules<a class="headerlink" href="#the-rules" title="Permalink to this headline">ÔÉÅ</a></h2>
<p>Our goal here, in the long run, is for you to become a skilled
expert who is independent, capable of critical thinking, and
ethical. The journey is quite long, there are no shortcuts,
but will be quite enjoyable every now and then.
To guide you through it, and not to get lost, we have a few rules for you.</p>
<ol class="simple">
<li><p><em>Follow the rules.</em></p></li>
<li><p><em>Technical textbooks are not belletristic.</em>
Sometimes a single page
will be very meaning-intense. Do not try to consume too much
at the same time. Go for a walk, reflect on what you have learned,
build connections between different concepts.
In case of any doubt, go back to one of the previous sections.
Learning is an iterative process, not a linear one.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Solve all the suggested exercises.</em>
Also, try to implement most of the methods for scratch
instead of looking for copy-paste solutions on the internet.
How else are you going to master the material and learn the
necessary programming skills?</p></li>
<li><p><em>Code is integral part of the text.</em>
Good code can be as good as good maths. Do not skip it.
On the contrary, you should play and experiment with it.
Run every major line of code and inspect the
results generated. What it the type (class) of object returned.
If it is an array or a data frame, what is its shape? And so forth.
What would happen if we replaced X by Y?
Do not fret, your computer will not blow up.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Who knows, they knows.</em></p></li>
<li><p><em>Learn maths.</em>
Our field has a very long history and stands on the shoulders of
many giants; the methods we use these days are merely minor variations
on the classical, fundamental results that date back to
Newton, Leibniz, Gauss, and Laplace. Therefore, in the long run,
you will need some working knowledge in mathematics
in order to be able to understand them (linear algebra,
calculus, probability and statistics).
Remember that software products/APIs seem to change frequently,
but they are just a facade, a flashy wrapping around the methods
we have been using for a very long time.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Use only methods that you can explain.</em>
Despite they may be easily accessible,
you should refrain from working with
algorithms/methods/models whose definitions
(pseudocode, mathematical formulae, objective function they
are trying to optimise) and properties
you do not know, understand, or cannot rephrase in your own words.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Compromises are inevitable<a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="#freelunch" id="id2">2</a>.</em>
There will never be a single best metric, algorithm, way to solve all
the problems. Even though some solutions might be better than others
with regards to some criteria, this is only true
under certain assumptions (<em>if</em> they fit some theoretical model).
Beware that sometimes focusing too much on one criterion
leads to undesirable consequences with respect to other ones.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Best things in life are free.</em>
This includes the open source software we use in our journey.
Spread the good news about it and ‚Äì if you can ‚Äì contribute something
so that you are not only a taker
(even as small as reporting typos in their documentation
or helping others of different forums when they stuck with something).
After all, it is our common responsibility.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Be scientific and ethical.</em>
You should develop a dose of scepticism and impartiality
towards everything, from marketing slogans to hotly debated topics.
Most data analysis exercises end up with conclusions
like: ‚Äúit‚Äôs too early to tell‚Äù, ‚Äúdata don‚Äôt show it‚Äôs either way‚Äù,
‚Äúthere is a difference, but it is insignificant‚Äù,
‚Äúyeah, but our data sample is not representative for the whole
population‚Äù ‚Äì and there is nothing wrong about it.
Remember that it is highly unethical to use data to tell lies;
this includes presenting only one side of the very complex reality
and totally ignoring all the other ones.
Using statistics for doing bad things
(tracking users to find their vulnerabilities,
developing products and services which are addictive)
is a huge no-no!</p></li>

<p>This book has been prepared in a Markdown superset
called <a class="reference external" href="https://myst-parser.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html">MyST</a>,
<a class="reference external" href="https://www.sphinx-doc.org/">Sphinx</a>, and
TeX (XeLaTeX) .
Python code chunks have been processed with the R (sic!)
package <strong class="program">knitr</strong> <span id="id10">[<a class="reference internal" href="999-bibliography.html#id78">Xie15</a>]</span>.
