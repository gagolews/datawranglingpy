# Minimalist Data Wrangling with Python

*Minimalist Data Wrangling with Python* is envisaged as a student's first
introduction to data science, providing a high-level overview as well as
discussing key concepts in detail. We explore methods for
cleaning data gathered from different sources, transforming, selecting, and
extracting features, performing exploratory data analysis and dimensionality
reduction, identifying naturally occurring data clusters, modelling patterns in
data, comparing data between groups, and reporting the results.
