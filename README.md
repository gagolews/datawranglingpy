# Minimalist Data Wrangling with Python

*Minimalist Data Wrangling with Python* by [Marek Gagolewski][1]
is envisaged as a student's first
introduction to data science, providing a high-level overview as well as
discussing key concepts in detail. We explore methods for
cleaning data gathered from different sources, transforming, selecting, and
extracting features, performing exploratory data analysis and dimensionality
reduction, identifying naturally occurring data clusters, modelling patterns in
data, comparing data between groups, and reporting the results.

For many students around the world, educational resources are hardly
affordable. Therefore, I have decided that this book should remain
an independent, non-profit, open-access project.
Whilst, for some people, the presence of a "designer tag" from a
major publisher might still be a proxy for quality, it is my hope
that this publication will prove useful to those who seek knowledge for
knowledge's sake.

[Marek Gagolewski][1]
is currently a Senior Lecturer/Researcher in Applied AI at Deakin University
in Melbourne, VIC, Australia and an Associate Professor in Data Science
(on long-term leave) at the Faculty of Mathematics and Information Science,
Warsaw University of Technology, Poland and Systems Research Institute
of the Polish Academy of Sciences.

He's an author of 85+ publications, including journal papers
in outlets such as *Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (PNAS)*,

His research interests include machine learning, data aggregation and
clustering, computational statistics, mathematical modelling
(the science of science, sport, economics, etc.), and free (libre)
data analysis software
([{program}`stringi`](https://stringi.gagolewski.com) – one of the most
often downloaded R packages,
[{program}`genieclust`](https://genieclust.gagolewski.com) – a fast
and robust clustering algorithm in both Python and R,
and many [others](https://github.com/gagolews)).
