## About the Author

[Marek Gagolewski][1] (pronounced like Mark Gaggle-Eve-Ski ðŸ™ƒ)
is currently a Senior Lecturer in Applied
AI at Deakin University in Melbourne, VIC, Australia
and an Associate Professor in Data Science (on long-term leave)
at Faculty of Mathematics and Information Science, Warsaw University
of Technology, Poland.

He is actively involved in developing *usable* free (libre) and open source
software, with particular focus on data science and machine learning.
He is the main author and maintainer of [stringi][3] â€“ one of the most often
downloaded R packages that aims at natural
language and string processing as well as the Python and R package
[genieclust][4] implementing the fast and robust hierarchical clustering
algorithm *Genie* with noise point detection.

He's an author of over 80 publications on machine learning and
optimisation algorithms, data aggregation and clustering, statistical
modelling, and scientific computing. Moreover, Marek taught various courses
related to R and Python programming, algorithms, data science,
and machine learning in Australia, Poland, and Germany
(e.g., at [Data Science Retreat](https://datascienceretreat.com)).
